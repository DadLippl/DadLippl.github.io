        <h1>DeMolay quick start guide</h1>
        <p>Now you can say, <strong>"I am a DeMolay!"</strong> Congratulations from the millions of brothers around the world. This guide gives you the essentials to jump in, connect with your Chapter, and start experiencing DeMolay.</p>

        <h2>What is DeMolay</h2>
        <p>DeMolay was founded in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1919 by Frank Sherman Land with nine young men from the community. It has grown into the premier international fraternal organization for young men ages 12–21, shaping leaders of character. The name honors Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, remembered for fidelity to his brothers and cause until his martyrdom.</p>
        <p>DeMolay International incorporated in the 1990s as a nonprofit and is also known as the International Supreme Council of the Order of DeMolay. Chapters exist in 26 countries across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, with independent Supreme Councils in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the Philippines. DeMolay is part of the family of Freemasonry and related organizations.</p>
        <p>DeMolay is youth-led. You and your brothers run meetings, plan events, lead service projects, and take workshops that build skills for life. Advisors teach, guide, and assist—but this is your organization. The more you put in, the more you get out. Show up with enthusiasm, participate faithfully, and support your brothers with positive energy.</p>

    <section id="your-chapter" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Your chapter</h2>
        <p>Chapters conduct business meetings using Robert’s Rules of Order and a prepared agenda to ensure fairness, efficiency, and clarity. The agenda guides openings and closings, reports, bills, upcoming activities, voting, and member announcements. Important decisions are voted on by the members and recorded in the minutes. Stand and wait to be recognized before speaking.</p>
        <h3>Leadership and offices</h3>
        <p>The foundation of a Chapter is its members. With experience, members join committees, serve as officers, and take on leadership roles. Three officers are elected to serve sequential terms: Junior Councilor (junior vice president), Senior Councilor (vice president), and Master Councilor (president). The Master Councilor also appoints 19 officers with distinct duties. Traditions vary by Chapter and are kept alive by current members.</p>
        <h3>Advisory council</h3>
        <p>Each Chapter has a certified, background-checked Advisory Council focused on the health, safety, and welfare of the members. The Chairman liaises with the Sponsoring Body and oversees activities per By-Laws and regulations. The Chapter Advisor works directly with officers and members to plan and execute events and meetings. Other Advisors mentor committees, teach leadership, provide transportation and chaperoning, and support whenever asked.</p>
        <p><strong>Call to action:</strong> This is your Chapter—jump in, give your best, seize opportunities, be a teammate, and shape your future.</p>

    <section id="your-responsibility" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Your responsibility — your fraternity</h2>

        <h3>Keep a calendar</h3>
        <p>Most Chapters publish a Term Plan in print or digital form. Track event dates, times, locations, and details using your preferred method. Manage contacts and get connected to your Chapter’s communication app.</p>

        <h3>Ritual</h3>
        <p>The Ritual contains ceremonies for openings/closings, welcoming new members, and teaching DeMolay’s lessons. Members learn and perform parts from memory as they gain experience.</p>

        <h3>Our traditions</h3>
        <p>DeMolay “secrets” are historical traditions handed down for over 100 years. They unite us and are explained in your Ritual book, including grips (handshakes), passwords, signs, word of the day, and how to kneel as a DeMolay. None conflict with your beliefs, morals, or DeMolay’s core values—a senior member will help you learn them.</p>

        <h3>The obligations and proficiency</h3>
        <p>After induction, your next step is becoming a voting member. Demonstrate understanding of the seven core values by memorizing and repeating your pledges in the Chapter room. Any member can help you find them in the Ritual and practice. Proficiency is about understanding the lessons and building public speaking confidence—more than memorizing words.</p>

        <h3>Dress code standards</h3>
        <ul class="dress-code">
          <li><strong>Formal:</strong> Tuxedo or dark suit; tux pants or dress slacks (no cotton pants); tux/dress banded-collar or dress shirt; tie or bow tie; dark dress shoes and socks; honors/awards as appropriate.</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-formal:</strong> Suit, blazer, or sport coat; dress slacks (no khakis/cotton pants); dress or banded-collar dress shirt; tie required; dress shoes and matching dress socks.</li>
          <li><strong>Business casual:</strong> Dress slacks/pants/khakis (no jeans); polo or collared dress shirt (no tie); leather dress shoes and dress socks.</li>
          <li><strong>Casual:</strong> Nice jeans (no holes); collared or polo shirt; shoes and socks.</li>
          <li><strong>DeMolay casual:</strong> Nice jeans or appropriate shorts; DeMolay shirt required; athletic shoes (no sandals) and socks.</li>
          <li><strong>Sporting:</strong> Jeans, sweats, shorts, swimsuits, T‑shirts, sweatshirts; athletic shoes or sandals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ask before you go, and remember—it’s easier to dress down than dress up.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Your chapter meetings</h2>

        <h3>Attending a chapter meeting</h3>
        <p>Before each meeting, get the “Word of the Day” from the Sentinel. During the Opening Ceremony it will be collected by the Deacons. The Chapter Advisor selects a new word or short phrase for each meeting, usually reflecting DeMolay ideals. During an opening on the DeMolay Degree, you’ll use the “Password” from your induction.</p>

        <h3>Moving around the chapter room</h3>
        <p>“Walking bands” guide uniform movement and will be taught to you. Never pass between the Altar and the Master Councilor unless required by the Ritual. Stay in place unless instructed.</p>

        <h3>Gavel raps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One rap:</strong> Brings order/attention and directs everyone to be seated.</li>
          <li><strong>Two raps:</strong> Officers rise.</li>
          <li><strong>Three raps:</strong> Everyone rises.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Kneeling for prayer</h3>
        <p>DeMolay welcomes anyone with belief in a Supreme Being(s) and shows no preference among religions. The kneeling posture has non-religious historical meaning, recalling General George Washington praying for his soldiers. If unsure of the form, ask a brother or Advisor. Hint: left knee, right elbow, left hand, head down; at “Amen,” count to three; watch the Chaplain to kneel and stand.</p>

        <h3>Arriving late / leaving early</h3>
        <p>If late, go to the Sentinel (or knock twice if no one is there). After raps and instructions, you will be admitted on the Initiatory or DeMolay Degree. Proceed to the Altar, give the sign, and take a seat when invited by the Master Councilor. To leave early, go to the Altar during a break, give the sign, and the Junior Deacon will let you out.</p>

        <h3>Nine o’clock interpolation</h3>
        <p>If a meeting includes the hour of nine o’clock in the evening, a special prayer is given for mothers, fathers, and DeMolay. Lights are dimmed and a gong strikes nine times. The Master Councilor, Marshal, and Chaplain conduct the ceremony. At “Amen,” DeMolays and Senior DeMolays respond in unison: “God bless mother. God bless father. God bless the purposes of DeMolay. Amen.”</p>

        <h3>Titles of respect</h3>
        <p>In DeMolay, Advisors are respectfully addressed as “Dad” or “Mom,” a tradition honoring “Dad” Frank Land and the early members who saw him as a father figure. Members often address each other as “Brother,” reflecting our family-like bonds.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Communication and follow the rules</h2>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Find your Chapter’s primary communication tool (e.g., Slack, Band, Messenger, Discord, Email) and get signed up. Ensure your Chapter Advisor and Master Councilor have your contact info (and your parent(s)’ info), and you have theirs. Communication is a key life skill—and a DeMolay priority.</p>

        <h3>Follow the rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Core values:</strong> Keep the seven core values at the forefront: Filial Love, Reverence for Sacred Things, Courtesy, Comradeship, Fidelity, Cleanness, and Patriotism.</li>
          <li><strong>Youth protection:</strong> Recognize, resist, and report any safety concern. If something feels wrong, report it to any DeMolay authority immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Meetings:</strong> Follow Robert’s Rules and the agenda. Stand and wait to be recognized to speak.</li>
          <li><strong>Valuables:</strong> Avoid bringing valuables. If necessary, give money/medication/important items to the designated Advisor for safekeeping.</li>

          <li><strong>Conduct policy:</strong> No smoking or vaping; no weapons; no inappropriate language, materials, or behavior; no violence; no bullying.</li>
          <li><strong>Guests:</strong> Significant others may attend many activities (check with the Chapter Advisor) with no serious public displays of affection. A Medical Release Form for guests is recommended.</li>
          <li><strong>Obey the law:</strong> Respect local, state, and national laws. Think twice before acting once.</li>
          <li><strong>Check in/out:</strong> Always check in with the lead Advisor when arriving or leaving, even temporarily.</li>
          <li><strong>Common sense:</strong> Don’t do what you know shouldn’t be done. You represent DeMolay at all times.</li>
