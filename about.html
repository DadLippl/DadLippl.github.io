        <h2>Our Vancouver Chapter</h2>
        <p>
          The Vancouver Chapter of DeMolay has served young men in the Southwest Washington area for decades. Known for its strong leadership and community involvement, the chapter was one of the first to pilot the Squires program in the state.

        <h2>The DeMolay Program</h2>
        <p>
          DeMolay International is a youth leadership organization for young men aged 12 to 21. Built on the values of filial love, reverence, courtesy, comradeship, fidelity, cleanness, and patriotism, DeMolay helps members develop lifelong skills through mentorship, public speaking, service, and ritual.

        <h2>The Squires Program</h2>
        <p>
          The Squires program is designed for boys aged 9 to 11 who are not yet old enough to join DeMolay. It introduces them to the principles of friendship, leadership, and service in an age-appropriate and engaging format. Many Squires go on to become active and successful DeMolays.

        <h2>Mentorship Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Dedicated adult mentors are the cornerstone of DeMolay’s success. These advisors, often former members or community leaders, help guide young men as they develop into future leaders.
          <br><br>
          The Order of DeMolay was founded by Frank S. Land in 1919 in Kansas City. He believed that every young man deserved guidance, support, and the opportunity to grow with purpose — ideals that remain central to DeMolay today.
