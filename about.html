      <h2>Our Vancouver Chapter</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 1922, the Vancouver DeMolay Chapter has faithfully served young men in the community for over a century. From its early days at the historic NorthBank Masonic Lodge to today, our chapter has been a cornerstone of leadership development and character-building for youth in Southwest Washington.

        <h2>The DeMolay Program</h2>
        <p>
          DeMolay is a well-established youth leadership program for ages 12–21, emphasizing the values of honor, service, and brotherhood. Through ritual practices, community service, and public speaking opportunities, our members learn to become confident, morally guided leaders who make a positive impact in their communities.

        <h2>The Squires Program</h2>
        <p>
          Established in Vancouver in 1997, our chapter proudly launched the first-ever Squires Manor under the leadership of Dad Edgar Trefts. Designed for boys aged 9–11, this program focuses on Wisdom, Truth, and Justice—offering age-appropriate training in character, teamwork, and civic responsibility as a prelude to DeMolay membership.
